        <h1>404 Error</h1>
        <p>Sorry! It looks like you're trying to access a page that doesn't exist.</p>
        <p>Considering this site literally has one page (well, technically two pages if you count this
        one, I guess), I don't know how or why you did that. It's a bit disconcerting.</p>
        <p>Click <a href="http://mfedarko.me/">here</a> to be taken back to the index page of my site,
        or feel free to email me at <pre>mfedarko (at) umd (dot) edu</pre> with
        questions/concerns/suggestions on how to make this website/404 page better.</p>

        Here's a picture of my cat for your troubles. &lt;3
