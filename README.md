My website. Accessible at https://fedarko.github.io/.

As of March 12, 2018, http://cbcb.umd.edu/~mfedarko should redirect here.
http://cbcb.umd.edu/~mfedarko/828O should also redirect to the 828O/
subdirectory here.

The styling of the site was inspired by
http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com, which was created by
[Drew McConville](https://twitter.com/drew_mc) and [Gabe Hammersmith](https://twitter.com/gabehammersmith) :)
